# A Neural Network to Classify MNIST handwritten digits
***

This is a neural network with one input layer (784 units), two hidden layers (28 units), and one output layer (10 units). For the hidden neurons, the sigmoid activation function is used. For the output neurons, the softmax is used in conjunction with a cross entropy loss function.
